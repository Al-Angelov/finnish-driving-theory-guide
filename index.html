    <h2>Extra Tips & Resources</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Practice under test-like conditions</li>
      <li>Focus on priority rules and traffic sign questions</li>
      <li>Use official or trusted simulators for mock tests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One personal recommended path that I would suggest is to first pass all of the material at your online driving school. Then I would suggest to get familiar with the test format, and check out the links with the practise questions. Finally I would recommend checking out "Nettitreeni", which should have been provided by your driving school. In Nettitreeni there is an unlimited amount of mock exams that you can take as well as you can practise the different sections of he theory exam individually. If you practise that one hard, you are sure to pass the thery test with no struggle! Especially if you remember to save the wrong answers you got, and review them later. For example by taking a photo of each wrong answer, and what the correct answer would have been.</p>
